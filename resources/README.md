# datasource-resources

This folder is having all the necessary stuff to bring up the redis-stack and postgresql in local.

The Redis-UI will come up on port `8001` and the redis server will be up on `6379`. 
PostgreSQL server will come up on port `5432`

The username for redis client is `default` and the password is `secured-redis`
The username for postgresql is `postgres` and the password is `secured-postgres`

If not familiar then use, _upstash_ for redis and _neon_ for the postgres instead.
